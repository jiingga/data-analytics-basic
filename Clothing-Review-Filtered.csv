5,"A fun dress to just throw on go, nice details in the bodice, mix of blues in the prints, little longer in back is nice detail for those of us who want a shorter dress but not the worry of flashing from behind"
5,"Absolutely love the design, fabric, and fit of this dress! a perfect dress for many occasions, one of the many reasons i love this company! excellent customer service, employees, and of course adorable clothing. 10/10 would recommend buying this dress! and to all the taller girls, i am 5'11"" and 170lbs and this dress is still a good length! no need to continuously pull down and worry about who might see your rear."
5,"Adorable & comfortable. i'm 5'3"", 115 lbs, and ordered an xs."
5,Adorable denim dress! fabric is lighter than i imagined but is very flattering. perfect length. this is not a form fitting dress at all so if you're going for that pass on the dress or possibly order a size down.
5,"After reading some reviews about it running small i decided to order the 8 instead of my regular size 6 and bingo! i'm 5""7' 144 lb. dress hits right above my knees. i'm between slender and curvy."
2,"After the second wash, the stitching in the armpits completely fell apart. after sewing it back up, wearing it, and washing it a third time, the stitching in the other armpit completely fell apart as well. not sure if this was just a fluke, but it was very disappointing. now that both armpits are sewn and all other stitches are intact, i must say that this is a great dress. i would have returned the dress to retailer, but i've already washed and worn it, so again...very disappointing. i would say"
1,"Although i love retailer, this product isn't the quality or presentation i expect from them. the dress arrived stuffed into a small plastic bag and was a crumpled mess. the fabric wasn't soft and fluid as i expected, but rather was stiff and a little scratchy. i purchased the ecru version, which was also slightly darker than the photo showed. i returned the dress and will keep looking."
5,As other reviewers have stated it is hard to see in the photos that the dress has iridescent blue/pink/lavender sequins. i was surprised as well but in a good way. i think it has a unique look and is so pretty and romantic. its a vision of shimmer when you are walking. if you have somewhat of a bust i would size up because the triangles run a little small. other than that its a beautiful dress.
5,"Cute design, the fabric drapes well, conceals many possible figure flaws, and has an upbeat, easy vibe. i got a small and am 125 lbs and 5'4"". i also washed it on a short cycle on cold and put it in the dryer for 5 minutes, which worked out just fine. great dress!"
5,Cute print got lots of compliments when i wore it. lightweight. looks great with boots
5,Fabulous dress for both quality and design. the embroidery is gorgeous and the long sleeves make it practical to begin wearing immediately. true to size and flattering. looks darling with booties.
5,Finally saw this dress online. i have to say that it looks better in person. the model might be too tall for this dress. i am 5'4''. it's right to my ankle. the color is in a nice off white. the material is a good quality. the overall cut is nice. it's a kind of classic feeling.you could wear it for a long time without going out of style.
5,"Gorgeous pattern, even prettier in person! runs slightly large in my opinion, could size down. nice to have as a petite option."
1,"Hahaha..this dress is hilarious! it looks nothing like the image! i am usually a 0/xs, and 4 was the smallest size available, so i ordered it. when i opened it, it felt like 10 lbs of fabric. i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big, until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress. once i looked in the mirror, i almost fell over laughing. the rest of the dress is huge. i don't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone."
4,"I am 5'8"" size 4-6 us. i could barely zip the inside bra on the 8. i wear 34 b. i think it is uk sizing. i kept the 8 ( had to return the 6). it's a beautiful dress but it is a lot of dress. maybe too much for someone more petite. it looks ridiculous until you put the belt on:)"
5,"I am returning the dress because it smells heavily of the last purchaser's deodorant and perfume. it was actually nauseating to put on. i am disappointed with retailer that i was sold this dress, full price, in this condition. otherwise, the dress is lovely. it is true to size. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs and the size 0 was perfect."
5,"I am so glad i read the reviews for this before i purchased it. i am 5'5 and 135 pounds and normally wear a size 6 in dresses. i would normally buy a small, but sized down to an xs and it was perfect! it's a beautiful dress and very flattering!"
4,"I am typically a 14-16 and the dress is true to size. (xl) i live that the embroidery runs the full length of the dress. i also like the shimmery side seam detail. the front cut near the shoulders is very flattering on. one minor issue is a gap in the bosom area due to button placement. however, i plan to add a snap t i fix. i often have this issue as i am large in that area. the length is flattering as well and provides great coverage in the rear. lightweight and flows nicely. the color is wond"
5,"I am usually a petite 6 but since this dress did not come in petites i tried on 4 and it fit. i'm 5'1"" -112lbs so dress hit rt below knee -will have it hemmed up a bit do not so overwhelming.

this dress looks stunning on! great vibrant color ( i have dark hair) makes this classic elegant dress look contemporary and stylish. when i tried it on in store, salesperson and others who happen to see it on me raved and told me to grab it! i did and am glad.

i plan to wear it this spring for my daughte"
4,"I am very frustrated. i ordered the pxs and pxxs back in may...at the time they were both on back order until early august. last week i received an email that the pxxs was no longer available. i emailed customer service and got the reply that the shipment of pxxs was damaged and so that's why they were no longer available. i did receive the pxs and while the length is good for me at 5'4"" it is enormous through the entire body (shoulders down to the hemline!) i know the pxxs is the size i needed"
2,"I bought this dress for a holiday party, and the sequins on the dress were so much more blue that what it looks like in the photo. i still liked it, but when i went to try it on, it was just not working. i thought this was more of a loosely fitted look, but the upper bodice and waist seam are very tightly fitted. i would recommend sizing up, but be aware that the top straps (shoulder to breast) are too loose to begin with, so they may sag.

overall, i wouldn't recommend this dress for the curren"
4,"I definitely trend towards preferring my clothes looser as a style but the fit on this dress felt a bit too boxy, i typically run between and x-small and small, should have gone with the x-small. i loved the print and quality of the dress though and would recommend it!"
5,"I fell in love with this dress as soon as i saw it. it does fit more loosely than i typically prefer, but the colors and the patterns have such personality that it didn't matter. i wear mine both as a dress and with leggings for the windy days. this is one of my new favorites!"
5,"I fell in love with this dress from the moment i saw it on various mother's day weekend insta posts by retailer stores. i was worried that it would not be a great cut for me, as it's pretty straight up and down, and i wasn't sure the waist would hit at the right place, because i'm super high waisted and this didn't appear to be so. in truth, it isn't, and i'll be tying the ribbon (or wearing a slim belt) at a higher point than where was originally intended. however, what struck me was the ability"
4,I found this dress on sale in store and i usually stay away from this style/cut because i have a curvier lower half but to my surprise the dress was still flowy and fit the top nicely. i'm usually a small in tops and a 30 on bottom but it worked for me and i get a compliment every time i wear it!
5,"I had to return the 2 for a size 4 and it is still snug in the ribs. i am very petite and usually wear size 0 and xs. the regular length hits me perfectly above the knee as i like. the previous review to order up was good but i'm writing to say i had to go up 2 sizes. i am 5'5"" 110 lbs, small frame."
5,"I just got this today & love it. the embroidery on the front is gorgeous & rich looking. the material is soft & has a nice weight so that it drapes perfectly & is not at all see through. it will look great with sandals, flats or sandals with heels. i wear an xs & it fits tts. it falls just above the knee. i can see me wearing this a lot. i was worried about it looking too youthfull for my age, but it doesn't at all."
5,"I just love this dress! it is so pretty and feminine and comfortable. the colors and patterns are perfect for both spring and fall and i know that this is one piece that i will get a lot of use out of. originally, i thought the cut would be a bit boxy but it is not at all. in fact, the fabric is beautiful, soft, and flowy with a lovely bohemian aesthetic. it looks great with tights, tall boots and a big floppy wool hat. any one considering this dress should defiantly try it on, as it is highly u"
2,"I just received this in the mail today. first of all there was no slip included and the fabric is totally sheer. the description says ""viscose lining"" so i assume there was a slip and from the picture it looks like it was a beige color. second of all, it was obviously sent from a store where they lost the slip and it was squished into the smallest possible retailer envelope. the fabric is beautiful but the dress is humongous like the previous reviewers said. i ordered a size smaller than us"
3,"I like my clothes loose fitting but even for me this ran large, i am 5'7 134b and medium fit in the shoulders but was too big overall"
4,"I liked the way the dress looked in the front, but the material in the back was knit and very clingy. i did not think it was flattering on me."
5,"I love this dress because it's so comfortable and has this hippie peasant vibe that i don't generally wear. plus it's a three season dress with pockets! bought the medium but i should have sized down to a small. on top i'm a m/l girl and the medium is huge. i'm not going to exchange since i wear a sweater over it right now. this dress looks good with or without a belt, with long boots, booties and sandals. so happy with this purchase!"
5,"I love this dress so much, very detailed and comfortable. looks great with the pilcro vest."
5,"I love this dress! perfect with high boots. and the quality of fabric looks and feels great. fits just like it shows in the picture.

i am size 6 and i ordered the medium and its flows well on me. i like it a little looser for that boho look."
5,"I love this dress, saw it online and went to try it on in the store the next day. this dress is perfect! the pattern stands out but isn't too overwhelming. i'm 5'4"" 120lbs and 32ddd i bought an xs and i love the fit. it's just the right amount of fabric to be flowy without being excessive. one thing i've found with flowy dresses is they make you look preggers if you have a large bust however this dress is nothing of the sort. seriously if you find your size in stock snatch it up!"
5,"I love this dress. it is very cute and comfortable and great for football games / everyday wear. it is a little long, which is great for me since i'm taller."
5,"I love this dress. the length is great and the dress just feels great. the material is raw silk (which i love) and the sizing does run a tad large, but with the make of the dress. i can lose weight and still wear the dress. well made and the buttons in back are super cute."
5,"I love this dress. the pattern is fun, the style is relaxed and breezy for spring/summer, and it is well-made. a steal at the sale price! also, it has pockets :) a huge plus for me. since it is a loose-fitting style, i would say it run just a tad big. i bought the s petite and i am 5'4"" 115lbs. i could've gone xs petite ...but the s fits well and looks great. the pattern is stunning. a great addition to my summer wardrobe. i thought about pairing it with a fitted white pant, but it hits me right"
3,"I love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress. unfortunately, it just didn't work for me. i'm a larger, busty lady (size 14) and i tried on the xl. it fit fine, but did absolutely nothing for my figure. it just kind of hung on me. even with the belt tie i still feel like it didn't accentuate my waist line. i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure."
3,"I ordered a size 4, my usual size is a 4 or 6. the tunic fit well through the torso, but the arm length was too short and hit just below the elbow. the sleeve interfered with arm bending and moving. i have petite proportions so the arm length of regular size garments is usually too long. i don't want to go up in size because the body of the tunic might be too roomy."
1,"I ordered the ivory of this dress, expecting it to be a nice dress i could wear into my second trimester of pregnancy. instead, i received a dress that looks like a ugly, vintage-gone-wrong curtain of fabric. the 'ivory' is the color of yellowed newspapers. the fabric was cheap and had thread pieces sticking up all over the place. i would've been better off sewing myself a dress out of drapes a la gone with the wind or sound of music. the fit isn't that great, either. big and boxy. it could acco"
5,"I ordered this dress in the green ,and i love it. it does run a little large so i went down one size, which was ok by me!! it is super cute!!"
3,"I purchased the green dress in medium. i usually wear a medium. the fabric is pretty. shoulders fit nicely. sleeves were short in an odd length, but that is indeed pictured accurately. the body of the dress is very shapeless, billowy and wide, which made this appear far more like a nightgown than the photo shown. i considered altering the garment, by sewing in the sides from the armpit downward, but i decided to return the dress."
5,"I purchased the green print which has so many patterns and colors which makes this dress have a very interesting look. i love that it has a drop waist because it is so flattering to most body types.the other thing i liked was that this dress came in petite sizes, perfect for me."
3,"I really wanted to like his dress, but it was a big miss. big big miss. look at the way the skirt is attached to the dress in the photo. it goes up high on the sides leaving a short bodice. the sequined patterns hit right at my breasts, so it looked like glittery bra cups on the front. the back glittery pattern looked like bird wings on my back. it was far shorter than i expected. overall, it looked like i was desperately trying to be a sexy angel or fairy. bad bad bad."
5,"I saw this dress in the store & loved the print so much i had to try it on. i definitely do not own anything like this. i tried on a m & i agree that it runs large & on my petite hourglass frame it was a bit overwhelming. however, i was prepared for that & paired it with a brown belt & absolutely loved it. the belt made the dress a little shorter & definitely accentuated my curves in a good way. such a beautiful, casual dress that is actually comfortable. i can't wait to wear it with tights with"
5,"I saw this dress in the window at the portland store, and had to try it on. i was a bit horrified at how huge it was once i got it on--sort of like wearing a tent. no shape at all. one of the awesome dressing room attendants brought me a belt, and suddenly it was the most beautiful dress i've ever had on. it's romantic, elegant, feminine... the fabric is so lovely and the flowy sleeves with the lower scooped back just look fantastic. i can't say enough about how amazing it makes me feel. i wore"
4,"I saw this online and loved it instantly. i happened to come by it in the store and tried it on. it was almost perfect. but sadly, being busty makes the dress hang not quite as well as it could. i think this might be a better dress for the less busty/less curvy. but it is super cute and fun!"
4,"I tried on the xs and the shoulder are fit, but the body seemed so wide on me, it took me over... i don't know if xxs would have worked, but it is not available (and petite either). fabric is soft enough for denim, color is nice, overall, really pretty dress, just unfortunately big.

and i have wide shoulders.

30dd chest, 26.5 in wasit, big legs, 115 lbs."
4,"I tried the size small on at my regular store, and thought the subtle, sophisticated color and the embroidered pattern were beautiful, though the dress was clearly too long for me in the shoulders, neckline and armholes, and the lower hem.

i ordered the small petite online, hoping that it would fit perfectly, but the top of the dress fit the same as the regular size had in the store. the only difference was that the bottom hem was a little shorter and a better length for me.

i bought the dress"
5,"I tried this dress on in-store and fell in love with it as soon as i put it on. it's beautifully made, the fabric is soft, comfortable, and free-moving, and overall it has a lovely vintage, romantic look. i actually ended up wearing it for a family photo shoot the next week, and was pleased with how it looked in our photos as well, especially the lovely way the fabric draped. another reviewer said it seemed baggy and oddly-shaped; it does seem shapeless before you tie the waist tie, but once tha"
2,"I was looking for an oversized silhouette but this is more like a beach cover-up. the waist does not have elastic or any structure. the top fabric is crossed over but not sewn closed, and because the fit is so loose it just gaps open. the fabric is nice quality but i am returning."
5,"I was not sure about ordering this dress, but i'm glad i did! i love the cut and all the details...very unique! i am usually a 10 and the medium fits me perfectly. love, love! if you're on the fence about ordering this dress, i say go for it. for reference, i'm 5' 6"" and the hem hits me mid-calf."
5,"I was so skeptical about ordering this; it's really not my style. i'm more of a black halter dress kind of person. this is so cute, and flattering. it's well made, not flimsy, but is soft and pretty. i'm 5'6"" and weigh 130. i bought the small and it fits perfectly; the dress hits me right above the knee in front. i can see myself wearing this with cute sandals and a floppy hat at a beach bar, or wearing it wiht6 leggings ans shooties when it's cooler and dress it up with jewelry. side note; i'm"
3,I was very excited to get this but very disappointed once it arrived. the fabric on the back is thin and clingy. i think you'd have to wear a slip underneath. cute design on the front but sadly it's going back.
2,I was very surprised to see such dark blue sequence on this dress. it did not appear as it did on the photo. i was pretty disappointed by the color. the photo of the dress is much more impressive.
5,"I was worried at first that the metal leaves would come off easily. i was pleasantly surprised after a day at disneyland, i don't think i lost even one of them. this dress is super fancy but very comfy."
5,"I will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer. they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch, see, try on and order through the store (which is much appreciated). i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available. the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here.

i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee"
5,"I'm not normally one to spend $89.99 on a dress from retailer, but when this dress arrived in the mail it was a no-brainer that i would keep it. it hangs beautifully on your body and the fabric is extremely comfortable the tie at the waist is really flattering and the neckline adds a little bit of fun. i imagine it can go from season to season pretty easily: springtime with a cardigan and flats --> summer with wedges --> fall with tights and boots. i love pieces that can serve different purposes a"
2,"I'm not really sure what the designer was trying to accomplish with this dress. the fabrics and details are pretty but the shape is really strange. for one thing, the dress has a very straight cut so there is not a lot of room for movement and the thin belt makes the shape even worse. i felt like i was wearing a really fancy garbage bag. also, the way the bottom flares out is just strange considering the cut and length. i really wanted to like this dress but unfortunately it was a complete miss"
5,"I've been looking for an off the shoulder trend item and this one fits the bill perfectly. the denim is a nice color and weight, love, love the pockets! the neckline is not too frilly, the sleeves are fluttery but not over the top ruffled. i wore this dress to lunch with cute flat sandals and i must say it looked adorable! sad i didn't find this earlier in the summer, but will wear when i can. my only concern is that it will shrink in length, i'm hoping not. this one will def be taken to the dry"
5,"Just got this dress in the mail yesterday and i love the style and fabric soooo much!!! the fabric looks kind of shiny in the photos so i wasn't quite sure, however in person it's a perfect blend that can easily be dressed up or down. sadly i cannot fully see how it looks on me because the bust of it is way too small. i normally wear a 0 or 2 in a dress and am a 32c but the inside panel that you cannot see in any of the photos is very fitted to the chest and i cannot even zip the size 2 over my"
3,"Like others reviewers mentioned on here, this dress is extremely well made. but there were too many cons for me, as well. this would most certainly work on a petite/shorter frame, but for tall, busty, and curvier girls, it just sits wrong on all places unfortunately. the color is lovely along with the nice collar that ties in the back really made this dress stand out.

however, i'm a 36c and found that the arm/shoulder part so large and bulky that is made me look bigger on top. there was entirel"
5,"Love everything about this: the length, cut, look, etc. i wear medium/large... went with medium and it was perfect."
4,"Love love this dress! i got the regular size, but the length is more on the petite side. it's shorter than what i'm comfortable with, so will probably return it."
4,"Love the way this looked online/on model. would not recommend for a shorter or curvy person such as myself. it just ended up looking like a very chic potato sack on me, and was not flattering."
5,Love this dress! it is very comfortable and stylish. looks great with flats or wedges. material is soft and comfy! definitely worth the price.
5,"Love this dress! i've been looking for a nice nursing friendly dress for a while and this one is perfect! its so soft and hangs nicely. its very versatile and can be worn for multiple seasons. i ordered a size small which fits nicely, but could have done an xs or small petite. (for reference, i am 5'2"", 118 lbs)."
5,"Love this dress! perfect length and i love the construction and where the seams hit (not too long, not too short). i got so many compliments with this dress!"
5,"Love this dress! really nice quality, timeless design, not to mention the flared sleeves are so flattering! this dress makes me feel so cute and tiny. i normally struggle to function in off the shoulder tops but deal with it because i love the way that they look, but this one really is the perfect fit and has just the right amount of give without being too loose. the body size and length does run large, so size down on this one. now i understand why the petites were all sold out? whatever, modes"
4,"Love this dress! sadly, it ran so large that it was literally falling off of me. because i bought it on sale, the option wasn't there to buy a smaller one. the quality is excellent and it's perfect for a spring or summer day in miami:-) sorry to have had to return it due to the sizing issue."
5,Love this dress! the color is gorgeous! what you don't see until you see the dress in person is the beautiful detail of the stitched flowers on the dress. i received so many compliments when i wore this dress. the sleeves are sheer and the material light weight. you can wear this dress year round. i love these kind of dresses! retailer knows how to do this right! love this store!
5,"Love trying things outside my usual style, thought this might look like a sack but fell in love! looks effortless, easy to accessorize, dress up or down & comfortable. keeper! want to try it with platform sneaks for casual look."
5,"Love, love, love this dress! the color is a beautiful blue grey, and the peach embroidery has just a tiny bit of sparkle. can be dressed up or down."
5,"Loving the ombrã© color combination, the smooth lining, the fuzzy felty warmth and the slimming effect when viewed from the front. if you are busty or hourglass, stay tts or size up. if you are straight and/or small busted, size down. if you have a round bottom but slender on top, i'm not sure this dress will fit the way you want, do try it on in person."
3,"Material is nice. design would be so great if it didn't fit so large! i am 5'4"" 118lbs, athletic build. the dress could be belted i think (a very slim girl at retailer did this), but it is not worth $158 in my opinion. if on sale i might keep it due to the hastle of returning it, however, it is not ""flowy."" it fits okay in the shoulders, almost too loose, and the rest looks like a potato sack. so disappointed!!"
5,"On shopping trips i try to try on at least one thing that i like but don't think will look that great on me. this dress was that item today. not only did i like it, but i liked the way it looked on me. i'm 5'3"", 140 pounds and purchased the medium. i loved it, the clerks loved it, and my very honest daughter also loved it. i will wear it as a dress and also as a tunic over skinny jeans."
4,"Prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress. it definitely needs heels. i'm 5'4"", 120#, 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff."
4,"Purchased this dress at the sale price, with an additional 20% off sale, not exactly sure what to expect-- the print is so different than my usual style preference. so glad i did! while the dress is way oversized (for reference, i'm 5'4, 132 lbs) ordered size sm but prob should have gone with xs) it's stylish, yet effortless. today is the first day of wear (at my office) and already received many complements."
5,"Super comfortable and cute!! i have received tons of compliments one this dress. the material is soft and the print/colors are awesome. this dress will get a lot of use over fall, winter and spring. runs a little big. i am typically a s but chose the xs . love love love!"
5,Thank you to all of the reviewers who took the time to write a review. your reviews are what help me know exactly which size to order and how to know that i needed a regular instead of a petite. i'm 5'3 and typically wear a size 8 in retailer sizes. i went with a medium regular based on other reviews. thanks so much because the fit was perfect though still a little roomy.
3,"The design of this dress is darling and so unique, and it's very well made. but i agree it's very boxy and overwhelming for a petite frame. i'm 5'3"" and ordered the 2, and it was like wearing a hospital gown. if a petite were available i'd have tried that, but this one's going back. shame, too, because it's adorable. the gap in the neckline could easily be stitched or sewn shut, but that's an inconvenience when this dress is already priced so high."
2,"The dress is very pretty, but the sequins are dark blue! i imagined they would be silver/gold, given the photo, but the dress is essentially light pink and blue."
5,"The print, length and cut are all flattering. i bought the other tiny dress that was similar and will buy every pattern they make."
2,"The quality and fabric are fabulous but it's just too voluminous for my figure (5'8"", 155 lbs), would look great on someone more slender."
3,"The shape was not as nice on model, seemed like a lot of extra material."
4,"The style and fit are excellent, doesn't make you look frumpy or larger. just can't get into the pattern combo--the white is too stark and i feel like it was slapped on my chest like a dickey. i have the paquerette and that's a mixed bag of patterns that works really well. i'm not sure if i am keeping. i may have to bleed it out to soften the white. purchased size medium for my 36dd chest and wide rib cage."
1,There are darts that are not shown in this picture that make the dress ill fitted. not sure why they are not in the picture and on the dress. i wish the pictures shown were more accurate.
3,This dress did not work for me. it was shapeless and boxy. i tried to belt it but the white front looked odd. if you are tall and thin maybe but not for the short girls.
4,"This dress does indeed run large like the other reviewers mentioned, but it also runs small in the shoulders. i'm 5'3"" and usually a size 6. the xs fit perfectly in the body, but was a little too small in the shoulders. i liked the dress enough to size up to a small to fit the shoulders, and then just had the sides taken in slightly. i did purchase this dress during the 20% off sale, so that helped justify the cost of alterations."
4,"This dress is beautiful and would make an excellent party dress for winter. it is well made and the details are pretty. however the waist is cut in sort of a scallop shape, so it is higher on the sizes and dips down in the middle over the stomach. i wear a size l or 10 in dresses at retailer, and it just did not flatter my body type at all. for a thinner, narrow silhouette, i suppose it would look better, like it does on the model. i had to return it."
5,"This dress is beautiful. it may run a tad large. everything about the dress is very appealing from the nice fabric, beautiful design and colors of the print. it will go straight into fall. so very happy i tried it! i have a beautiful, elegant dress for the hot weather."
5,"This dress is incredibly soft, comfortable, and essentially lined (i mean, look at all that intricate embroidery... your skin has no idea it is there). the colors are lovely (the embroidery is sort of a soft peachy cream lined with gold) and the dress is even prettier in person. the neckline is low, but not too revealing, and, though i normally avoid shirts without sleeves, the cut is flattering around my arms. the cut of the hem is also flattering. in some ways, the belt seems like an extra pie"
5,"This dress is light, airy easy and comfortable to wear. i love the colors and pattern. it looks wonderful with or without a belt. i sized down from a 6 to a 4. i position the front of the dress material closer to the neck so it flows longer at the back. although i am a size 6 the under slip fits perfectly in a size 4. i prefer the dress without a belt but it also looks good with a belt or a jacket or long cardigan. 
this dress is a keeper!"
5,"This dress is one of my recent faves from retailer. the fit is great. i'm 5'8"" and 145. i ordered the small and it's perfect."
5,"This dress is so cute. i love that it has pockets. it looks great with sandels, and also ballet flats. it is airy, and run true to size. i wear a small, and it fit perfect. i even bought the other navy, and cream dress. you will wear this dress over, and over. just roll up the sleeves, and throw it on, and your ready. just love it!!!!"
4,"This dress is so pretty and the petite fits great in the arms and the length is good- just above the knees. the material is nice- not flimsy. i'm just not sure if it looks right on my petite, straight frame. the front is cute but the back is pretty baggy and shapeless. i've never worn a shirt dress so i'm not sure if this is how it's supposed to look? i tried it with a belt but it doesn't seem to work with this dress as there's a band of loose elastic. probably would look better on a curvier bod"
5,"This dress is stunning. i have been stopped in the street by people asking where the dress is from. my only complaint is that it was very wrinkled when i bought it. initially i thought it was supposed to be that way, but after seeing the stock photos i realized it needed to be ironed. it took a long time to iron all of the wrinkles out, but it is totally worth it."
4,"This dress is very small in the bust and maxi length on short people (5'3"" 36dd). i can't wear a normal bra, i have to use adhesive pasties. the fabric is very smooth, thick and satin like, but fuzzes easily. mine came with minor thread pulls and one strap was sewn on twisted. the pattern in real life is very pink as opposed to the model sample which has more blue landscape. i'd like to hem the dress but i would sacrifice pattern. still very pretty dress. be sure to size up one or two depending"
3,"This dress was pretty but had a weird fit. the waist droops down in the middle instead of going straight across, which i found unflattering. i ended up returning it."
1,This dress was very boxy and unflattering. i really wanted to like it because the blue and white details were so pretty but it had to go back.
5,"This is a beautiful dress! blend of materials give it a great feel, the cut and style are very flattering. colors allow it to be carried over multiple seasons either on its own or layered for colder weather! very happy with this investment!"
4,"This is a cute casual dress. i've received many compliments and wear it a lot. i deducted one star because the dress is pilling in some places (mostly expected friction areas, but others as well). also the back of the dress started to rip at the stress points for the button up area. i mended it, but it should have been reinforced to begin with for a dress at the original price point."
5,"This is a gorgeous dress. the print is beautiful and unique, however because it is baggy the dress does run big on smaller frames. i would definitely recommend sizing down."
4,"This is a lovely piece, with great shape and details. i think it would really stand out at events. i ended up returning it. i don't have much occasion for cocktail dresses. i had trouble sending it back. it has a slip with the sheer overlay. the slip seemed a bit tight at the bottom hem for the shape of the dress."
5,This is a pretty tunic but it just didn't look right on me. the colors are nice and you can easily hide body flaws.
4,This is an adorable dress that just didn't work for me! so sad! i wanted to love it because the pattern is super cute. i gave it 4 stars because it is very pretty and i can see it working on others!
4,"This is my second dress from this designer. it is very comfortable, stylish, and looks great with sandals/wedges. i would have given it 5 stars but the neckline was a little lower than i expected and the length was a little longer. i am still keeping it though and expect to wear it spring, summer, and fall."
5,"This is one of my absolute favorite dresses of the season! fun, flirty and fashionable! i wore it with a chunky necklace, floppy hat and sandals one time and with wedges and dangly earrings the other time. it is a must own dress!"
4,"This was my first tiny shirtdress purchase after seeing the past few patterns/seasons. for me the last few were a little too busy, but something about both patterns this season felt right for summer. i'm 5'7"", 128# and found my usual s to be too long in length and in sleeve length (the sleeves being a problem that i never have). going to try to exchange for an xs because it really is a lovely piece in both colors (though i slightly prefer the green because it feels more tropical/exotic for summe"
5,"Wanted this dress several months ago, but it was out of stock. finally was able to order and very glad i did, it is perfect! it fits exactly as i had hoped, the length is great, right above my knee and it hangs beautifully. looks great with my caramel colored boots and i received many compliments. just hoping they do some more drop waist dresses, especially for summer."
4,"Went to the store in search of a butter dish. tried this dress on a was shocked at how comfortable, versatile and all over appealing this dress is. i'm 5'10"" and the medium hits at my knees.  as always i think the quality could be better. it's not something that will last for years."
5,"What a dress! the print, the feel of the fabric, and the overall fit of this dress, it definitely has the wow factor! i plan on wearing this dress to the kentucky oaks this year. i typically wear a 6 and sometimes a 4 in retailer dresses. i'm 5'6'' 130 lbs 32dd and took a 6 in this. i could probably even try the 8. it fit a bit tight in the bodice for me but i'm not sure if it warranted a size up. it is pricey but i see this being a closet staple and one of my favorite maxi's yet."
1,"When i ordered this online, i should have paid more attention to the picture. the dress comes to the knees of the 5'10"" model. i was swimming in small petite size. i checked the label and wondered whether i received the wrong size. nope, it was ps. either the dress was mislabeled, or this is cut huge. returning. too bad because the shape and color are cute."
5,"You know how you hope that a dress that you order online is as good as you think it will be? well, this one is better then i had hoped! it fits beautifully. it is crafted beautifully. there is nothing i don't like about it. i was pleasantly surprised at how light the fabric is. i thought it might be a heavier denim, but it is perfect. not so light that you can see through it, but cool and breezy even in the florida heat. do yourself a favor and grab this one before it's gone!"
